<h3 style="text-align: center;">AI-based healthcare for Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis
</h3>

Diabetes is a disease that can kill you. Due to the lack of target assessment equipment for automated detection, almost 84 percent of diabetics are unaware that they have the condition. Diabetic Retinopathy is an eye disease that can cause diabetics to lose their vision and become blind. Diabetic Retinopathy should be identified quickly and correctly, yet clinician variability exacerbates the cutting-edge DR treatment's unfavourable outcomes.

Healthcare(Diabetic Retinopathy) is a web-app that uses a range of cutting-edge models to transform the profession of ophthalmology. Traveling to gyms/yoga centres is neither safe nor viable due to the current pandemic, which brings our concept to light. Using a Yoga Bot that recognises the user's posture while performing the Asana, the web-app would not only predict the DR and the level of blindness, but it would also propose Yoga poses that have been shown to be useful in the treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy.

According to studies, simple report organisation leads to greater treatment efficiency. Furthermore, if a medical text report is unstructured, doctors are more likely to overlook vital information from their patients, therefore this summarizer ensures that no information is lost in the process of interacting with a doctor. As a result, a report is prepared based on the diagnosis results, which may be accessible by both the doctor and the patient for evaluation.
